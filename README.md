# MicroservicesProject
#This project contains 2 microservices that handle a different database respectively, profile works with a neo4j database and songs works with a mongodb database
#the 2 microservices communicate with each other to make sure they update the other database as needed, all the endpoints are in ProfileController or SongController
#the mongodatabase should be on localhost:27017 and the neo4j database on localhost:7687
#This project was collaborated on with Rui Wu.
